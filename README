Android application which communicates with github.com/MickaelSereno/SciVis_Server and github.com/MickaelSereno/SciVis_HoloLens.

You need first to compile :
    -glm
    -lib3ds
    -github.com/MickaelSereno/VTKParser
    -github.com/MickaelSereno/Math_Library
    -github.com/MickaelSereno/SciVis_Library

In app/cmakeArguments you can modify the pkgconfig prefix (default: my computer) for the different architecture. See also app/CMakeLists.txt for more details.

Everything that is in app/Resources should be pushed (e.g., via adb) to the local directory of the application com.sereno.vfv. For example: /sdcard/Android/data/com.sereno.vfv/files/
You you find in app/Resources/config.json a way to set the server IP adresse
